Contribution guidelines for clear documentation

Did you find a bug?

    Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

    If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

    If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description:
        Active Record (models, database) issues
        Action Pack (controllers, routing) issues
        Generic template for other issues

    For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our reporting guidelines.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

    Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
    Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
